        The Voyager Hall is currently managed by owner Daniel Garza. Opening in early 2023, the cafeteria has been enjoyed by many students and
        hopes to continue to do so for many years to come.

        The Hall began as an idea on keeping students focused in class at the University of Houston. While the cafeteria inside of the Brazos building
        was suitable for waiting students eating lunch, anyone who might have just arrived on campus via the school shuttle or the long 40 minute drive from
        the UH main campus might be unable to eat before their class starts. The hall was first made to support these "Voyagers" in their classes by 
        removing the distraction that prolonged hunger would bring. Thus the Voyager Hall was born.
        The Meals were introduced due to the Voyager Hall's increased popularity with students seeking something more filling before driving or shuttling
        home. To this goal, we strived to create dishes that are enjoyable, relatively quick to prepare, and filling.
